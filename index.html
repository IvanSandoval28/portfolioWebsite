        <h1 class="about">About Me</h1>  
        <p>Hey there! I'm Ivan, a passionate student at the University of California, Merced, majoring in 
          Computer Science and Engineering. Ever since I can remember, I've been captivated by the endless 
          possibilities that technology offers, and I'm thrilled to be on this journey of exploration and 
          discovery. 
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not immersed in the world of algorithms and programming, you can often find me strumming away 
          on my guitar, lost in the melodies that resonate within me. Music has always been my escape, allowing 
          me to express myself in ways words sometimes can't. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Another one of my passions is hitting the gym, where I find solace in the rhythm of my workouts. Whether 
          it's pushing myself to new limits or simply unwinding after a long day, there's something immensely 
          satisfying about the feeling of physical exertion. 
        </p>
        <p>
          But perhaps what truly sets my soul on fire is the great outdoors. Backpacking through rugged trails, 
          surrounded by towering trees and breathtaking vistas, fills me with a sense of awe and wonder.
        </p>
